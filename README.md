VeggieBox is a web application that allows customers to order fresh vegetable boxes online.
<br><br>
I originally started making this website to be used by my Dad, a greengrocer who struggled to keep business going during lockdown.
Currently, only the MVP is built (the customer UI) but I soon hope to add the admin UI so that my Dad would be able to manage orders he receives.

### Users can:
- Sign up/login (JWT authentication)
- Browse vegetable boxes and their contents
- Add boxes to their cart and adjust quantities
- Pay for the order (Stripe integration)
- View all past orders and their details

### Technologies:
- React frontend
- Springboot backend
- MySQL database
